this repo houses some random shit i wrote that does stuff for me. almost no one will want this stuff.

## dwim-youtube-dl
youtube-dl is fucking amazing. its one of the coolest / most useful things maintained by oss people that regular, normal humans see. but it doesn't do what i want it to do out of the box.

### features
- assumes everything is part of a playlist
- each file downloaded goes in a folder named after the playlist

- declare a flag that determines what library the target should go to
  - video vs audio right now
  
### DWIM naming history

dwim comes from someone in the history of LISP. i like the connotation of doing what /i/, in particular, mean, rather than the general 'try and figure out what i mean' that it has in history.

besides, based on the critics of the DWIM system i feel like my interpretation is more accurate anyway.
