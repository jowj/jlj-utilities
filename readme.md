# utils
this repo houses some random shit i wrote that does stuff for me. almost no one will want this stuff.

## dwim-youtube-dl
youtube-dl is fucking amazing. its one of the coolest / most useful things maintained by oss people that regular, normal humans see. but it doesn't do what i want it to do out of the box.

### features
- infer if the item given is part of a playlist or not
  - if its in a playlist, each file downloaded goes in a folder named after the playlist
  - if its not a playlist..what should happen?

- declare a flag that determines what library the target should go to
  - video vs audio, etc
